## Description
This repository will house the code I'm using to practice general programming concepts in java. 

## Use Instructions
Currently this package houses Java code and small executables to make it quick to write and see the results of 
your attempts at solving problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms. These will be split into folders
depending on general categories. 

If you are interested in using this package structure for your own use I reccomend you create a fork of the project.

## Setup
Assuming you are using a Unix based system in these steps. For others like Windows you will need to make
alternative instructions yourself. 

1. Make sure you have Java installed on the machine you will be working on. 

2. Clone the package: 
```
git clone https://github.com/discocorg/JavaPractice.git
``` 

3. Run 
```
setup.sh
```

4. Now you can run any Java Program you create as a part of this package with the command: 
```
jprun [FILE NAME WITHOUT EXTENSION]
```

Example:
```
jprun StringPermutationDetector
```

## Data Structures and Algorithms
Folder includes small programs created for practicing general Data Structures and Algorithms.
